# Detect_the_PPE_KIT_in_Automobile-Manufacturing
## Introduction
This project aims to detect Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits in an automobile manufacturing environment using computer vision techniques.The project focuses on enhancing safety protocols in industrial and manufacturing environments through the use of deep learning and object detection. The system aims to ensure compliance with safety regulations by detecting unauthorized human presence and verifying the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) on workers.

## Project Objectives
1. Restricted Zone Monitoring: Detect unauthorized human presence in defined No-Human Zones.
2. PPE Compliance Detection: Identify and verify the presence of required safety gear such as hardhats, gloves, safety vests, masks, and goggles.
3. Identity Verification: Authenticate workers using facial recognition technology to ensure compliance with safety regulations and access control policies.
